Long ago, explorers claimed the jungle was enchanted, its rivers and trees guiding weary travelers toward hidden wonders. Today, it has become a famous destination, where visitors can trek beneath towering canopies and hear the same songs that once stirred legends. Dining is part of the adventureâ€”guests feast on open-air banquets with fruits plucked fresh from the trees and meals cooked over glowing jungle fires. As the night falls, lanterns hang from branches, turning the heart of the jungle into a glowing restaurant unlike any other in the world.
