Long before Mowgli ever walked its trails, the jungle was said to be born from the tears of a great sky-spirit, who wept until her rivers carved the land green and wild. The animals, once scattered across the earth, gathered here to live under the ancient Law of the Jungle, which was whispered to them by the oldest banyan tree. Legends tell that Shere Khanâ€™s ancestors once protected the jungle, but their pride turned to hunger, and the balance began to crack. Still, the jungle endures, its vines and shadows guarding secrets older than any man who dares to enter.
